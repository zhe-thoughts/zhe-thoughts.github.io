title: Paper review: Tachyon (SoCC '14)
---
## Summary
[Tachyon](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/publication/tachyon-socc/) is a distributed caching layer on top of disk-based file systems such as HDFS or GlusterFS. The core idea is to use lineage to provide **lightweight, optimistic fault tolerance**. 

> More importantly, due to the inherent bandwidth limitations of replication, a lineage-based recovery model might be the _only_ way to make cluster storage systems match the speed of in-memory computations in the future. 

Extending from "[Spark](http://spark.apache.org/research.html)", Tachyon also assumes an elegant *Lambda-calculus-flavored* model, where new datasets are generated by closed-form operators (e.g., *map* and *group-by*) from existing ones. This empowers Spark and Tachyon to persist the operator binaries -- whose sizes are negligible -- instead of replicating the datasets themselves. 

The results are amazing: Spark allows you to program with PB-sized variables; and Tachyon provides a name space for those variables to be shared among applications. In short, **the cluster becomes your computer**. 

## How significant and fundamental are
The initial idea of Spark was similar to [MapReduce Online](https://code.google.com/p/hop/). However, the **lineage-based optimistic fault tolerance** model greatly generalized and *externalized* inter-job intermediate results, bringing them to the unprecedented stage of programmable units.
