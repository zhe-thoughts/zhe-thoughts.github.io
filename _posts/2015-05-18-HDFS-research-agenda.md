title: My HDFS Research Agenda
---
Approaching its 10th or 4th year, depending on how you count it, and 9000 JIRA issues, HDFS is still a young project. Scores of interesting technical problems await solutions. HDFS touches many active research areas in the academia: operating system, data storage, distributed computing, just to name the major ones. More joint research projects between universities and companies would benefit both sides in unique ways, and advance the entire big data industry. 

Almost a year into HDFS development, below is my personal collection of open problems that should be studied more scientifically.
