I was born in the Xi'An city in northwestern China, and did my undergraduate study in the [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/). In 2004 I started graduate school at the [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu) co-majoring in Operations Research and Computer Science. After finishing my Ph.D. study in the [PALM](http://research.csc.ncsu.edu/palm/index.htm) research group led by Dr. [Xiaosong Ma](http://qcri.org.qa/page?a=117&name=Xiaosong_Ma&pid=154&lang=en-CA) in November 2009, I worked in the [Technology Integration Group](http://techint.nccs.gov/) in the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://www.ornl.gov) as a staff scientist for one year. In November 2010 I joined the [IBM T. J. Watson Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/) as a research staff member, where I worked on cloud computing technologies with a focus on SaaS/PaaS offerings. At IBM Research I co-chaired the Professional Interest Community (PIC) in [Storage Systems](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=155). My work received IBM Research Accomplishment Award and Outstanding Technology Achievement Award in 2013. From 2014 to early 2016 I worked at Cloudera working on [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/). I led the design and development of [HDFS Erasure Coding](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-7285), which is a major new feature for Apache Hadoop 3.0.

I'm currently a software engineer at [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com) working on exciting big data problems around Hadoop.
