I was born in the Xi'An city in northwestern China, and did my undergraduate study in the [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/). In 2004 I started graduate school at the [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu) co-majoring in Operations Research and Computer Science. After finishing my Ph.D. study in the [PALM](http://research.csc.ncsu.edu/palm/index.htm) research group led by Dr. [Xiaosong Ma](http://qcri.org.qa/page?a=117&name=Xiaosong_Ma&pid=154&lang=en-CA) in November 2009, I worked in the [Technology Integration Group](http://techint.nccs.gov/) in the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://www.ornl.gov) as a staff scientist for one year. In November 2010 I joined the [IBM T. J. Watson Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/) as a research staff member, where I worked on cloud computing technologies with a focus on SaaS/PaaS offerings. At IBM Research I co-chaired the Professional Interest Community (PIC) in [Storage Systems](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=155). My work received IBM Research Accomplishment Award and Outstanding Technology Achievement Award in 2013.

I'm currently a software engineer at [Cloudera](www.cloudera.com) working on [HDFS](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html).
